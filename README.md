# Drug-Classification

Project Overview:
The project aims to classify drugs into different categories using machine learning techniques. It will utilize AIML for building the classification model and Jupyter Notebook for presenting the code and results.

Project Structure:

Introduction:
Explain the purpose of the project and its significance.
Briefly introduce AIML and its role in drug classification.
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Source the dataset containing drug samples with their corresponding categories.
Preprocess the data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the dataset to understand its characteristics.
Analyze the distribution of drugs across different categories.

Model Building:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
Fine-tune the model parameters if necessary.
Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for real-world use (optional).

Conclusion:
Summarize the findings and the effectiveness of the model.
Discuss potential future improvements or extensions to the project.

Tools and Libraries:
AIML: For building the classification model.
Jupyter Notebook: For code presentation and documentation.
Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

GitHub Repository:
README.md:
Provide an overview of the project.
Include project structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
Code folder:
Contains Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) with detailed code implementation.

Data folder:

Implementation Tips:
Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook for clear explanations and documentation.
Divide the code into sections with descriptive headings.
Include comments in the code to explain complex or important steps.
Visualize the results using plots and charts for better understanding.
Use markdown cells to provide insights and interpretations of the results.
Make sure to include necessary imports and dependencies at the beginning of the notebook.
Provide clear instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results.
By following this structure and implementation tips, you can create a comprehensive drug classification project using AIML and Jupyter Notebook for GitHub. This project will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in drug classification or machine learning applications in healthcare.
